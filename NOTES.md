### NonEIPMultipleTo NOTES:

This is an intentionally lame test, to validate that multiple to() statements can achieve the same effect as a more formal Multicast or RecipientList EIP

Motivation for the test is more about curiosity than anything else.

### To Test Visually:

 * Run XbcTest
 * [refresh IDE]
 * see file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt in root of project
